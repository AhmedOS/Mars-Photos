# ðŸ›¸ Mars Photos
NASA has three rovers on mars, and they are taking photos almost everyday since the day they landed on mars, and all of these photos are available on [this API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos). This app consumes that API.

# Dependencies
#### CocoaPods:

# API Key
The app uses `DEMO_KEY` as the API key, but it has very limited requests. For more freedom, request your API key from [here](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key), and change `key` value at `/Utilities/API.swift` file with your key.
